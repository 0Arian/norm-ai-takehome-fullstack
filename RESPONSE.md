_robust and user-friendly?_

Answer:

AI Regulatory agents are super vital for legal purposes, especially as the political framework of the United States and other countries changes very rapidly.

For instance, as of September 7, 2025 President Trump has signed over 150 executive orders while in office.

These pose as unique challenges, as LLMs are only trained up to a certain timeline, so agents that can browse different news sources and also have a database of legal information is extremely vital. An agent having the correct amount of information would be able to solve challenges a business or legal firm may face given the executive orders in this instance.

One challenge is making sure we're able to query the AI with proper data and the AI giving accuracy.

The AI giving accuracy is by using a variety of techniques (proper data like using rag, setting temperature to 0, making sure system prompt is set so it fails if it cannot handle the task, etc)

Another challenge is depending on RAG for a lot of legal data response, RAG is super popular but it is not the best way to query data, it just doesn't cut it. RAG is awesome at looking for data / content that is similar to what the user has queried, which makes it problematic.

Sometimes you may need key information that RAG might not be able to pull for you because that information that conveyed document filtered was conflated. (i.e. if you needed to pull the timeline of law changes to thievery but your RAG pipeline only had the definition of each thievery law made in the past, you might not be able to pull the relevant timeliens).

I would personally address this by either fine-tuning the actual LLM or working on a data cleaning solution and tokenization of my data in a minor machine learning sense if I had to still use RAG to answer my users query.

One other challenge is Data Privacy, sensitive data is going to come in and a lot of firms are worried about the big model providers using that data to train.

You can solve this one typically by isolating the AI to your own cloud (Bedrock, Vertex, Sagemaker, etc), Zero Data Retention Agreements, and etc.
